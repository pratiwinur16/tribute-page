			<h2>Biography</h2>
			<p class="lead"> Alan Sidney Patrick Rickman (21 February 1946 – 14 January 2016) was an English actor and director known for playing a variety of roles on stage and on screen.
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">Renowned actor Alan Rickman, a former member of the Royal Shakespeare Company rose to fame with his portrayal of the Vicomte de Valmont in ‘Les Liaisons Dangereuses’. The versatile stage actor made an easy transition into films though for a while he faced the danger of being typecast as a villain actor after his portrayal of Hans Gruber in ‘Die Hard’. He did not posses the prominent features or the unsettling glint in his eyes which one normally associates with a villain, but he had something else that made him suitable for such characters. 
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">He had a personal aura of unpredictability and sophistication that made him the perfect choice for playing the suave villain in style. The fact that he became typecast as a villain actor after just one film is a testimony to the acting skills of this great artist. Over the duration of his long career, he also played comic roles and romantic leads. He also acted in television movies and his role of the monk Grigori Rasputin in the HBO production ‘Rasputin: Dark Servant of Destiny’ won him a Golden Globe Award. He played the role of villain in several installments of the Harry Potter Franchise in which re-established his penchant for playing the evil guy. .</p>
			<p class="text-justify">Rickman died from cancer on January 14, 2016, in London. As one of the most admired British actors of the past three decades, his passing saddened his collaborators and many fans.

"There are no words to express how shocked and devastated I am to hear of Alan Rickman's death," tweeted Rowling. "He was a magnificent actor & a wonderful man."</p>
